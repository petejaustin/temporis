SEMANTIC DIFFERENCES: ONTIME vs TEMPORIS
=========================================

Game: game_0001_chain_3 at time=1
Target Set: {s0, s1}

GAME STRUCTURE:
- s0 [Player 0] -> s1 [available at times (4,15)]
- s1 [Player 1] -> s2 [available when time % 4 == 2]  
- s2 [Player 0]

At time=1:
- Edge s0->s1: NOT available (only at times 4,15)
- Edge s1->s2: NOT available (1 % 4 = 1 â‰  2)

RESULTS COMPARISON:

ONTIME (v0.1.0):
  W_1 = {"s0", "s1"}  # Both s0,s1 can force target reach
  W_0 = {"s1"}        # s1 in Player 0's losing region

TEMPORIS (GGG-Compatible):
  Winning Regions:
    s0: Player 0      # s0 can force win for Player 0
    s1: Player 1      # s1 allows Player 1 to win  
    s2: Player 1      # s2 allows Player 1 to win

KEY SEMANTIC DIFFERENCE:

The tools handle "already at target" differently:

- ONTIME: If starting at target nodes {s0,s1} at time=1, 
  reachability goal is immediately satisfied
  
- TEMPORIS: Appears to require actual game play/movement,
  not just "being at target location"

This reflects different interpretations of temporal reachability:
1. "Immediate satisfaction" (ontime) vs 
2. "Strategic reachability" (temporis)

EDGE CASE IDENTIFIED:
When no moves are possible at target time, solvers diverge on
whether being at the target constitutes winning the reachability game.
